        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          <p>
        This website was developed as part of an academic project during my first year of university and is meant solely for demonstration and learning purposes. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Bentley Motors or any of its official brands or representatives. The use of Bentley-related branding, images, and content is purely symbolic to reflect a realistic and professional web design scenario for portfolio purposes only.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing and browsing this website, users agree that the content provided is for educational and non-commercial use. All elements including text, layout, and design were created by myself as a way to apply foundational web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users are not permitted to copy, reuse, or distribute any parts of this website for commercial gain or without proper credit to the creator. The website has no commercial functionality and does not sell products, offer services, or collect user data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any trademarks, logos, or references to Bentley or any third parties are used under fair use guidelines for educational demonstration. If you are a representative of any brand mentioned and would like content to be removed, please contact the site creator via the linked GitHub profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website is static, meaning there are no interactive forms, payment systems, or active server connections. The purpose is to showcase technical skills and creative design thinking while following basic web compliance practices. These Terms and Conditions exist to clarify the purpose of the project and protect both the creator and visitors from misunderstanding its nature or purpose.

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This website was created purely for educational purposes as part of a university assignment and does not collect or process any personal data from users. We are fully committed to respecting the privacy of all visitors. No information is gathered, stored, or shared through forms, cookies, or any tracking technologies. Users are free to browse the website anonymously without needing to sign up, log in, or provide any identifiable details.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site does not make use of analytics tools such as Google Analytics, and no background data is being tracked or logged. If any interactive elements or buttons are present on the site, they are for visual demonstration only and do not transmit or store any user data. Additionally, the website does not contain e-commerce features, payment gateways, or login systems that might collect sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any external links are included in the design (for example, links to Bentleyâ€™s official site or social media), users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of those third-party websites separately, as this project does not take responsibility for their content or privacy practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student project, this website has no backend or database connection. Therefore, no user activity is monitored or stored. The privacy of visitors is completely protected by default. This policy is intended to demonstrate an understanding of responsible web development and data protection, which are essential parts of modern digital experiences. If this site is ever updated in the future to include real user interaction, a full and proper privacy framework will be implemented according to industry standards.
